Parameter Setting of Deep Learning Neural Network: Acase Study of Website Classification.
The problem of detecting phishing websites hasbeen addressed many times using various methodologies from conventional classifiers to more complex hybrid methods. Recentadvancements in deep learning approaches suggested that the classification of phishing websites using deep learning neural networksshould outperform the traditional machine learning algorithms.However, the results of utilizing deep neural networks heavily depend on the setting of different learning parameters. In this paper,we propose a swarm intelligence based approach to parameter setting of deep learning neural network.
Therefore we import the libraries and tabular Dataset that we intend to use in developing physhing website classifier.
